----- Changelog -----

<=== Dec 19, 2019 ===>

-- commit 6d1b8a7 --
First code publish.

-- commit 9a20716 --
Duration of the calculation will be printed at the end of the run. Solved with two 'time_t' variables from '<time.h>' header (C Standard Library). Will be changed.

<=== Dec 22, 2019 ===>

-- commit 05f87b8 --
First experimental version with threads. 'std::async' is used to calculate the numbers in two different tasks.
'Thread()' handles that.

-- commit 388efde --
Some optimizations and important changes.

-- commit 1158d77 --
First use of 'std::future' and 'std::promise'. In order to manage that with 'std::thread', 'f()' function was added. Static 4 parallel tasks.

-- commit 24f8896 --
optimization through avoidance of recursvive calls in function 'S()'. See History Task on GitHub.


-- commit 56a27f9 --
Some code moves.

-- commit 0a98314 --
Really important commit. Instead of recalculating a lot of numbers, results will be cached. Decreases the duration.

-- commit b251916 --
Calculation areas are set in 'long' variables before, not in the thread calls.

-- commit 4520317 --
Some optimizations in 'Thread()' to improve the process balancing.

<=== Dec 24, 2019 ==>

-- commit a371d9e & 8448fe2 --
Not working build. First try in usage of 'std::mutex'.

-- commit c9c2aef --
Working build. Secure access to global 'cache' variable with 'std::mutex'.

-- commit f413bdb --
Code formatting.

-- commit 30eaf71 --
Number of threads is now flexible and depends on the PC. First use of 'std::hardware_concurrency' to set the threads count.

<=== Dec 28, 2019 ===>


-- commit bc8b5b4 --
Joined functions 'A()', 'M()', 'S()' and 'f()' into one.

-- commit 9812e23 --
First step of making this code to a module: moved all public functions to struct 'Calculation<Type>'. To calculate one or more numbers, create an object of the struct above initialize it with a list. All numbers will be handled in 'Calculation<Type>::calculate(...)'.

-- commit 137cb85 --
Set number back to 500 and fixed output.

-- commit 7618edf --
Fixed incomprehensible calculation error. It appears that this error existed since some commits before. Now it should work.

-- commit 9e02f6c --
Added 'std::flush' to empty the puffer. In addition, the percentage output has been optimized in order to avoid multiple prints with the same percentage.

-- commit 433e4ab --
Added mutex to lock and unlock the print function.

-- commit 234c317 --
Support for calculating multiple numbers has been fixed and some output changes.

-- commit 91039ca --
Equip smost data types with key word 'unsigned' to move the value range. Through that, the biggest number of long long which can be saved is much higher.

-- commit 4c0563c --
Formatted console output to make the experience with this project more powerfull ;-)

-- commit b22321f --
Birth of this changelog!
